## Project Notes
In order to work quickly I decided to use 
create-react-app to bootstrap the project and to use Enzyme for testing. 
This helped save some time and showcase my React skills. 
 
 ### Clarification on Acceptance Criteria
 For this AC: "Clicking a second time on a previously highlighted number should remove all highlighting from numbers that are multiples of the number that is clicked." 
 
 I interpreted it as: "Clicking a second time on a number that has just been clicked should remove all highlighting from all numbers"
